## Information about the different brushes

1. The **pen** works like a normal pen. You can change the thickness and the shakiness.
2. The **stamp** draws lots of shapes on the canvas. You can choose from 4 different shapes (circle, triangle, square and nevergon). You can also choose the size of the shape.
3. The **path** tool allows you to draw paths made up of points connected together via lines. You can choose the size and thickness of the path.
4. The **eraser** is an eraser. The thickness can also be changed.

## Some ideas that didn't make it

* I wanted to make a "turtle" brush but utterly failed
* I originally had a variable "UIScale" but then I realised that browsers have a feature that allows you to change the scale of the website.
