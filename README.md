# Nordic Paint

###### This is my Computer Studies assignment.

---

Features of this paint app include:
- 3 completely independent brushes - pen, stamp and path
- Each brush has its own colour and selector
- Different stamp shapes (including a picture)
- Light and dark modes
- Using [Nord](https://nordtheme.com), one of the best colour palettes ever

Many aspects of Nordic Paint's GUI were inspired from the iOS Markup tool.

This is also still a work in progress, so I hope the teacher doesn't mind if I keep committing to this repo after the deadline.

Stay tuned for [documentation](https://frosetrain.github.io/nordic-paint/documentation), where I will write some stuff about my development journey, design decisions and some keyboard shortcuts.
