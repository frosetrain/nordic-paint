# Nordic Paint

###### This is my Computer Studies assignment.

---

Features of this paint app include:
- 3 brushes - pen, stamp and path, as well as an eraser
- Each brush has its own colour and size selector
- Shaky hand mode (more like "sprinkles mode")
- Different stamp shapes (including a picture)
- Light and dark modes
- Using [Nord](https://nordtheme.com), one of the best colour palettes ever

Many aspects of Nordic Paint's GUI were inspired from the iOS Markup tool.

Documentation is available [here](https://frosetrain.github.io/nordic-paint/documentation).
